# Configuration options for various plugin integration
# settings can be defined in this section. Each integration
# option has an enable option that tells the plugin whether
# or not the option should be used. These integrated plugins
# are essentially the same things as 'chatSettings.groups'
# and stack with any defined chat setting groups.
integration:
  # Herochat plugin integration options
  # Find the plugin here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/herochat/
  herochat:
    enable: false
    # Defines your Herochat chat channel that players must be joined
    # to receive messages from the auction plugin. Messages that
    # are only sent to a single player ignore this and will send no
    # matter what.
    channel: "auction"

# Configuration options for various chat group and handler features
# are defined in this section. As the plugin expands, more options
# will be added to this section.
chatSettings:
  # Configure which plugin groups view messages. All groups stack with
  # each other so players from multiple groups can be defined to view
  # messages
  groups:
    # 'global' is the standard broadcast group, this groups recipients
    # is all players online.
    global: true
  # The handler is the mechanism for how messages get delivered.
  # Current options are: TEXT, ACTION_BAR. The ACTION_BAR mechanism
  # will still send messages through the TEXT channel, however it
  # unlocks a new message option
  # ('messages.auctionFormattable.actionBarMessage') that is sent to
  # players whenever any broadcast message is sent. In the case that
  # you don't want the TEXT channel sending its respective messages,
  # you should disable the message by setting the message to "" (empty)
  handler: TEXT
  # This allows you to specify whether or not messages sent to the console
  # should be stripped of their color. Default: true.
  stripColorsForConsole: true

# Configuration options for various settings specific to auctions

  # of the auction will only be given $700 as a result. Default: 0.
  taxPercent: 0
  # The start time for all auctions. There is currently no
  # way to specify how long your auction should last through commands
  # and as such all auctions will have a duration of this time. This
  # time is configured in seconds and is translated through a utility
  # class to English. For example, if the time is set to 600, the
  # formatter will output '10 minutes'. Default: 30.
  startTime: 30
  # The delay between all auctions in seconds. This is the time
  # between when an auction ends and when a new auction from the queue
  # is started. Auctions that are created within the delay are
  # automatically added to the queue. Default: 5.

  # who attempt to create auctions when the queue is full will be denied.
  # Default: 3.
  auctionQueueLimit: 3
  # Defines the last time, in seconds, that users are allowed to use
  # the "/auction cancel" command. If an auctions time is less than
  # what is defined here, users will not be able to cancel their auction
  # anymore. Default: 15.
  mustCancelBefore: 15
  # Defined the first time, in seconds, that users are allowed to use
  # the "/auction cancel" command. If an auctions time is greater than what is

  antiSnipe:
    # Whether or not anti sniping is enabled. Default: true.
    enable: true
    # The time left, in seconds, in an auction that anti-snipe can

    enabled: false
    # Typically in sealed/blind auctions, bidders are only allowed to
    # submit 1 bid and then they must wait until the auction to see
    # who the winner is. This configuration option allows you to configure
    # how many bids a player is allowed to place (or raise their previous)
    # on the auction. Default: 1.
    maxBidsPerPlayer: 1
    # Setting this option to true will have an effect on the [topbiddername]
    # and [topbid] placeholders when a sealed auctions message is being
    # formatted. Rather than giving away the top bidder and top bid, the
    # formatter will replace the placeholders with "Hidden" and "hidden"

# Various settings unrelated to auction specific options are found in this
# section.
general:
  # A value that is used by the plugin to determine if your configuration
  # is out of date. This value should not be modified. The plugin will
  # tell you in console whether or not your config is out of date.
  configurationVersion: 7
  # This value allowed you to set the delay for when a players offline auction
  # item is given back to them after logging in. This functionality allows the
  # restoring of items after plugins such as PlayerSQL set a players inventory.
  # Default: 20 ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
  offlineRewardTickDelay: 20
  # Whether or not to shorten times that are formatted through the utility
  # class. For example, this is the difference between times being shown as
  # "5 minutes 5 seconds" vs. "5m, 5s". Default: false.
  shortenedTimeFormat: false
  # Whether or not to truncate any numbers that are formated into messages.
  # These numbers are monetary values (top bid amount, buyout, etc). Setting
  # this to true will have applicable numbers truncated. For example, the
  # number 1234 will be output as "1K", 99874 as "99K", etc. Default: false.
  truncatedNumberFormat: false
  # Whether or not to strip an items display name colors when outputing it
  # in auction formattable messages. Default: false.

    # This option will block commands when players have an auction in the
    # queue. Default: false.
    ifQueued: false
    # This option will block commands when players are the top bidder.
    # Default: false.
    ifTopBidder: false
  # A list of commands that are blocked if any of the settings in
  # 'general.blockCommands.*' are set to true. Commands here should
  # be defined as the players type them. For example, if a player
  # types /test hello, it will match the command '/test'. Keep in
  # mind that all commands are formatted to be all lower cases, so
  # commands entered here should be in all lower case.
  blockedCommands:
  - "/test"
  # A list of Bukkit Materials that are not allowed to be auctioned.
  # Valid materials: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
  blockedMaterials:
  - "BEDROCK"
  # A list of lores that are not allowed to be present inside any
  # lore strings on an item. For example, if we have "A string of
  # lore" defined in this list (default) and an item contains
  # the lore strings "hello", "this is lore", and "lol A string of
  # lore" the item will not be allowed to go into auction due to
  # the fact that "A string of lore" is present in the third line.
  blockedLore:
  - "A string of lore"
  # A list of times that the plugin will broadcast the amount
  # of time left in the auction. The format of this list can
  # be specified as it currently is ("["#", "#"]") or as above.

# Every message that is sent from the plugin is found in this section.
# The message keys are made to be as intuitive as possible so that
# you don't have much difficulty with figuring out what each message does.
# All messages are formatted for chat colors regardless if there are
# placeholder present or not.
#
# Notes: - ALL messages can be disabled by setting it's respective self
#          to "" (empty).
messages:
  # All messages under 'auctionFormattable' mean that messages sent
  # that are from here are first parsed with the current active auction.
  # There are various placeholders that you can insert into these messages
  # that will be formatted will information from the current auctions
  # information. These placeholders are as follows:
  # [itemName]        - placeholder for the raw name of the item being auctioned
  # [itemDisplayName] - placeholder for display name of the item being auctioned
  # [itemamount]      - placeholder for the amount inside the reward/item
  # [time]            - placeholder for the formatted time left (ie. 30 seconds)
  # [autowin]         - placeholder for the autowin balance in the auction
  # [ownername]       - placeholder for the name of the auctions owner. defaults to "Console" if null.
  # [topbiddername]   - placeholder for the name of the auctions top bidder. defaults to "Console" if null.
  # [increment]       - placeholder for the minimum increment inside an auction
  # [startprice]      - placeholder for the initial start price of an auction
  # [topbid]          - placeholder for the current top bid in the auction (untaxed)
  # [taxpercent]      - placeholder for the current tax percent set by 'auctionSettings.taxPercent'
  # [taxamount]       - placeholder for the current amount of money deducted by the tax
  # [winnings]        - placeholder for the resulting amount of money that will be won (after tax is deducted)
  # SPECIFIC MESSAGES ONLY:
  # [snipetime] - only works with antiSnipeAdd
  # [queuepos]  - only works with queuePosition and queueInfoLine
  #
  # Notes: - [ownername] and [topbiddername] will default to "Console" (w/o brackets)
  #          if there is no valid player entity in those placeholder slots.
  auctionFormattable:
    # The itemFormat is essentially the way [item] will be formatted inside
    # auction messages. For example, if you have a message that contains
    # "Hello [item]!", the [item] placeholder will be replaced with the items
    # name formatted as seen in itemFormat.
    itemFormat: "&b[itemName]"
    # The actionbar message is sent along ALL broadcasts made by the plugin. If
    # you don't want duplicate messages being sent through chat, you'll have to
    # disable the specific message by setting them to nothing (ie. "").
